# mean_std_variance-

In this project,the mean_var_std.py file is taken and the calculate function is written.Here firstly a list of 9 numbers are given as input list.Initially,check the ength of list,if it is less than 9,raise ValueError. Now,change list to array of 3x3 using numpy,then create a dictionary having some key and pair values. They include mean,variance, standard deviation,max,min and sum.In every key, the value contains 3 sub parts gicen in list format.
The fist part is a list of values of result of the operation done which is given in it's respective key name. For every column we perfoem the operation. The values of every row are given in second sub part, while the third one consists of the result of opeartion for all the elements in the matrix/array.
